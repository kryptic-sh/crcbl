//! Argument parsing for the towers sample.

//! towers [--headless] [--frames N] [--size WxH] [--tick-hz N] …
//! ```
//!
//! # This sample has no flags of its own, and that is the honest shape
//!
//! [`crcbl::args::Common`] owns `--headless`, `--frames`, `--tick-hz`,
//! `--backend`, `--size`, `--screenshot` and the debug-overlay pair. Slice 1
//! has one map, one tower type and one creep archetype, so there is nothing
//! left for a flag to choose — everything a player can change is a key.
//! `docs/plan/sample/07-towers.md` records the one flag rule 12 still owes
//! every sample, which is a way to hold a render path below what the device
//! offers.

towers — co-op tower defense; this slice is the solo loop on a hardcoded map

USAGE:
    towers [OPTIONS]

CONTROLS:
    LEFT/RIGHT           Pick a build plot
    B                    Build a tower on it. The server refuses a plot that is
                         taken and a purse that is short.
    N                    Send the next wave now rather than waiting out the
                         build phase. Waves arrive on their own either way.
    R                    Restart the run
    ESC                  Pause, F3 the debug panel, F11 fullscreen

OPTIONS:
    --headless           Run without a window (for CI / determinism tests)
    --frames <N>         Stop after N presented frames
    --tick-hz <N>        Simulation rate in Hz (default 60). Sets the server's
                         clock, the ECS timestep and every integrator.
    --backend <B>        GPU backend: vk, vulkan, mtl, metal, dx12, d3d12,
                         null, none, wgpu or webgpu
    --fullscreen         Open borderless instead of windowed. F11 still toggles.
                         A window system may refuse; the summary reports what
                         it actually did, not what was asked for.
    --pacing <P>         How frames are paced against the display: auto, vsync,
                         adaptive or off. Default: auto, which is adaptive sync
                         where the display is running it and vsync where it is
                         not. 'adaptive' is the one to ask for on a VRR panel.
    --fps <N>            Frame limit, in frames a second. Default: 1000, high
                         enough to be a runaway guard rather than a cap. 0 is
                         unlimited. Under vsync the display paces the loop and
                         this rarely fires.
    --size <WxH>         Window size in pixels, WxH (default 960x720). The
                         headless offscreen ring renders at exactly this extent,
                         which is what makes a scale measurement reproducible.
    --exec <LINE>        Run a console line before the first frame, after the
                         player's autoexec.cfg. Repeatable; the lines run in
                         the order given. The one way to set a console variable
                         on a --headless run, which reads no autoexec.cfg.
    --screenshot <PATH>  Write the run's last presented frame to PATH as a PNG.
                         Turns --headless on: the frame is read back off the
                         offscreen ring, which is the only surface every backend
                         can copy a presented image out of.
    --debug-overlay      Start with the debug panel visible (F3 toggles it)
    --no-debug-overlay   Start with it hidden. The default is 'visible in a
                         debug build, hidden in a release build'
    -h, --help           Print this help";
