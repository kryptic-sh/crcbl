//! The render layer, on whichever backend the registry opens — one frame of
//! [`Scene::Cube`] through [`ForwardRenderer`], read back and compared against
//! a checked-in golden.
//!
//! # Why this exists, and why here
//!
//! `docs/backlog.md`'s "The render layer has only ever run on Vulkan and wgpu"
//! is the gap: the frame graph, the cull pass, draw generation, forward and
//! tonemap execute on `crcbl-vk` (`crates/crcbl-vk/tests/vk_e2e/mesh.rs`) and on
//! native wgpu, and on nothing else. `crcbl-mtl`'s own suite proves the *HAL* —
//! dispatch, encoders, bindings, copies — and has never constructed a
//! [`ForwardRenderer`]. A green `mtl e2e` is therefore not evidence about the
//! renderer.
//!
//! This test is in `crcbl` rather than in `crcbl-mtl` because `crcbl` is the
//! only crate that depends on the renderer *and* on the backends: `crcbl-render`
//! is above the seam and names no backend, `crcbl-mtl` is below it and names no
//! renderer. A dev-dependency from `crcbl-mtl` on `crcbl-render` would be
//! acyclic — `crcbl-render`'s manifest takes `crcbl-hal` and nothing below it —
//! but it would have to rebuild the offscreen surface, swapchain, readback and
//! row-unpadding that [`crate::screenshot`](crcbl::screenshot) already owns and
//! that `tests/run-cross-backend-e2e.sh` already drives, and it could not assert
//! the thing a Metal run most needs asserted: that the *registry* picked Metal.
//!
//! # One test, every backend
//!
//! [`OffscreenSetup::open`] opens whatever [`crcbl::backend::open`] selects, so
//! `CRCBL_GPU` decides which backend draws and this file is the same test on all
//! of them. That is deliberate rather than incidental:
//!
//! * The golden is only trustworthy while something keeps re-deriving it, and
//!   the Metal arm cannot (see `run-render-e2e.sh` and the `mtl-e2e` job). The
//!   Vulkan arm is what stops it rotting.
//! * `docs/plan/02-vulkan-backend.md`'s shader-portability rule 5 — a shader
//!   compiles to all four targets and *means something different on each* — has
//!   already cost this repo two real bugs (`SV_InstanceID`, `SV_VertexID`), and
//!   both were caught only by rendering one scene through two targets. MSL is a
//!   target nothing has ever crossed. Comparing Metal's frame against a
//!   Vulkan-blessed reference is the same detector pointed at the third target.

/// 1. The backend that opened is the one that was asked for. Every backend
///    draws this scene identically by construction, so a Metal run that fell
///    back to wgpu would produce a passing frame and prove nothing about Metal.
/// 2. The adapter it opened is the class
///    [`ADAPTER_ENV_VAR`](crcbl::adapter::ADAPTER_ENV_VAR) named, and both the
///    adapter and the pin are printed. The same argument one layer down: this
///    frame died on `windows-latest` with `DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED` because
///    the first enumerated adapter is not a usable device there.
/// 3. The device's [`GeometryPath`](crcbl::hal::GeometryPath) is reported, and
///    the frame is drawn through whichever indirect tail it selects. Metal
///    reports no `DRAW_INDIRECT_COUNT` — the flag is absent from the API rather
///    than unimplemented — so it selects
///    [`IndirectPerBatch`](crcbl::hal::GeometryPath::IndirectPerBatch), the arm
///    that until now had only ever run on Vulkan behind a forced selector.
/// 4. Something drew: at least [`MIN_COLORS`] colours, a corner still holding
///    the clear, and a centre that is not the clear. A full-screen quad and a
///    blank frame both fail these and neither is distinguishable by a tolerance.
/// 5. The picture is the one that was reviewed.
