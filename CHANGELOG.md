# Changelog

All notable changes to this workspace are recorded here, in
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) form. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); below 1.0 a breaking
change bumps the minor.

Started partway through the project, so it covers changes from this point on
rather than the whole history — `git log` is the record before it. There are no
tags yet, so everything so far is unreleased.

Internal churn a release note would not mention — refactors with no outward
effect, test-only and docs-only changes, CI repairs — is deliberately left out.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **breakout**: the ball's speed ramps 2% per brick broken, capped at 1.6x the
  launch speed. A lost life and a restart both put it back.

### Fixed

- **breakout**: the ball is no longer under gravity. It launches at a constant
  speed and collisions change only its direction, which is what makes a shot
  aimable.
- **breakout**: the paddle steers, by being moved. A paddle standing still
  mirrors the ball like a wall; a paddle being driven left or right decides
  which way the ball goes next, and turns a ball back the way it came rather
  than rebounding it onward.
- **breakout**: the whole play field is on screen at every aspect ratio. The
  orthographic camera derived its width from a fixed half height, so a 4:3
  surface — the size the window opens at, and the aspect the web demo's canvas
  is styled with — cropped two world units from each side and the ball
  disappeared off the edge before bouncing back.
- **crcbl-phys**: `PhysicsWorld::sweep_sphere` reports contacts it used to miss.
  The broadphase traversed the sphere's centre line, so anything the sphere
  overlapped by less than its radius was dropped before the exact test, and a
  contact landed only once the centre reached the surface.
- **crcbl-store**: `canonical_key` and the browser backends split keys on `/` on
  every platform. Parsing went through `std::path::Path`, whose separators are
  the host's, so `a\b` was refused on Linux and quietly rewritten to `a/b` on
  Windows.
