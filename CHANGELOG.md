# Changelog

All notable changes to this workspace are recorded here, in
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) form. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); below 1.0 a breaking
change bumps the minor.

Started partway through the project, so it covers changes from this point on
rather than the whole history — `git log` is the record before it. There are no
tags yet, so everything so far is unreleased.

Internal churn a release note would not mention — refactors with no outward
effect, test-only and docs-only changes, CI repairs — is deliberately left out.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **flappy**: a second game, playable natively and at
  `https://crcbl.kryptic.sh/demos/flappy/`. One button, a bird under gravity,
  and an endless procession of pipes whose gaps are a pure function of a seed
  and the pipe's index — so the client and the server agree about the course
  without a byte of it crossing between them. It exists to find out whether the
  engine could host a game that was not breakout; what it found is written down
  in `docs/plan/ROADMAP.md`.
- **crcbl-hal**: `Device::take_error`, for the failures a backend learns about
  outside the call that caused them. Defaults to `None`, so a backend that
  reports everything through its return values is unaffected.
- **breakout**: the ball's speed ramps 2% per brick broken, capped at 1.6x the
  launch speed. A lost life and a restart both put it back.
- **crcbl-render**: `texture::upload_texture` and `UploadedTexture`, a
  format-agnostic staging upload. It replaces `ui_pass`'s private R8-only
  helper, whose row pitch was computed in texels and passed to a copy that wants
  bytes — correct only because `R8Unorm` is one byte per texel. The pitch is now
  computed in bytes and converted back once, at the copy, so an RGBA8 upload
  lands where it says it does.
- **crcbl-sprite**: a `load` feature — `decode_png`, `read_aseprite_json` and
  `load`, which take a baked sheet back apart into a `Sheet` and tightly packed
  RGBA8. §7 of `docs/specs/crcbl/pix.md` specified what the sidecar contains and
  nothing read it, so a baked sidecar was write-only. `SampleMode` does not
  survive the trip — Aseprite's schema has nowhere to put it — and that is
  asserted rather than assumed.

### Changed

- **web tooling**: `check-exports.mjs` and `smoke.mjs` take `--sample <name>`,
  and `run-browser-e2e.sh` takes `CRCBL_WEB_E2E_DEMO`. Each was written when
  there was one demo and asserted against the whole workspace or against
  breakout's own strings, so the second demo broke all three. A sample's
  contract is now scoped to that sample, and the browser gate refuses a demo it
  has no expectations for rather than passing on a game that never started.

### Fixed

- **crcbl-wgpu**: a shader module or pipeline that fails to build is reported.
  WebGPU hands back an object either way and delivers the reason to the device's
  error channel, so failures were invisible: the backend built a pipeline on a
  module that had not compiled and every submission after it was silently
  discarded, which presents as a black canvas over a game that reports itself as
  playing. Creation calls now return `HalError::Backend`, and the asynchronous
  half — the browser's, which no call can be blamed for — stops the frame loop
  from `GpuContext::acquire` with the driver's own message.
- **breakout**: the ball is no longer under gravity. It launches at a constant
  speed and collisions change only its direction, which is what makes a shot
  aimable.
- **breakout**: the paddle steers, by being moved. A paddle standing still
  mirrors the ball like a wall; a paddle being driven left or right decides
  which way the ball goes next, and turns a ball back the way it came rather
  than rebounding it onward.
- **breakout**: the whole play field is on screen at every aspect ratio. The
  orthographic camera derived its width from a fixed half height, so a 4:3
  surface — the size the window opens at, and the aspect the web demo's canvas
  is styled with — cropped two world units from each side and the ball
  disappeared off the edge before bouncing back.
- **crcbl-phys**: `PhysicsWorld::sweep_sphere` reports contacts it used to miss.
  The broadphase traversed the sphere's centre line, so anything the sphere
  overlapped by less than its radius was dropped before the exact test, and a
  contact landed only once the centre reached the surface.
- **crcbl-store**: `canonical_key` and the browser backends split keys on `/` on
  every platform. Parsing went through `std::path::Path`, whose separators are
  the host's, so `a\b` was refused on Linux and quietly rewritten to `a/b` on
  Windows.
